Description:

The Auto-Suggest Search Engine is a web app that shows suggestions as you type in the search box. It uses a Trie data structure, which helps find relevant suggestions quickly. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it works well on both computers and mobile devices. Users can easily see and select suggestions from a dropdown list. This project demonstrates how to use algorithms and data structures in web development. It's great for improving search features on websites like online stores and blogs.
